# From someone who uses it extensively

React is a great framework to be used for creating web pages. The componentization of front-end elements contributes to it being intuitive and easy to use than the rest of the frameworks out there. Here, we can insert some mathematical equations to see if this format is working perfectly or not

$$x^2 + y^2 = 25$$

What is the solution to this? Well, you guessed it right. It is  $$x=\plusmn 5$$ and $$y= \plusmn 5$$
