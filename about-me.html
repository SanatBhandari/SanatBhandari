							<h3><strong>About Me</strong></h3>
						</header>
						<p>My name is Sanat Bhandari. Originally from India, I just graduated with a B.S. (cum laude) in
							Computer Science and Mathematics from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. I am excited as I
							am about to start my Ph.D. in Computer Science at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln in Fall
							2020.</p>

						<p>My research interests lie in the utilization of deep learning for computational visualization
							and biomedical imaging. I am also interested in the application of machine learning to
							various marketing problems.</p>

						<p>In addition to my research interests, I am interested in technology and entrepreneurship,
							digital marketing, search engine optimization, economics, and foreign policy analysis. I am
							always looking for recommendations for literature in these domains so if you have any, feel
							free to send me a mail ðŸ™‚ </p>
